# Capstone-Stochastic-Gradient-Descent

This is the capstone with the thesis: Stochastic Gradient Descent and its application. 

The advisor Professor Song has helped me a lot and this is his GitHub link:

Also, my teammates Jing Guo and Yuning Ding did a great job in this work, here are their GitHub link, respectively:

## Deficiencies and Prospects
There are still some areas that need to be improved, such as the proof of the convergence theorem, the further discussion of the causes of some phenomena.What's more, the further improvement of calibration will be completed sooner or later.
